# Rebooting the project.
This project has been stalled for quite a long time.  
Instead I'll be building the Hack Emulator as a stand-alone project, the only file type it will read will be **.bin** files.  
Which the Assembler **(A separate project)** will generate.

# TODO modules

- [x] CPU module
- [x] VRAM module (want to put this in a separate thread)
- [ ] miniFB callback module (Mainly for keyboard support)

- [ ] Emulator Crashes (Memory Access Violation)
